# Kyle Nguyen's Portfolio

My name is Kyle Nguyen, I am a student at Cal State Fullerton. My major is Computer Engineering and I expect to graduate by 2028.

## Favorite CPSC120 Labs
* Lab 1, part-1

   This was my favorite because it was my first real introduction to writing and running code. I enjoyed the satisfaction of seeing my code successfully print messages and respond to user input. It gave me a solid foundation in basic programming concepts like variables and conditionals that I continued to build on in later labs.

* Lab 3, part 1

  This was fun because it was the first time I worked with loops and conditionals. I enjoyed creating programs that could make decisions and repeat actions based on user input. It made me feel like I was starting to really understand how to control the flow of a program.

* Lab 9, part 1

  I enjoyed this lab because it was when I really got to use "c out". I learned how to effectively translate text through files. I also liked writing code that handles I/O errors because that would be one less problem for my future projects.
